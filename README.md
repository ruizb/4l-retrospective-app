# 4L Retrospective App
This is an Elm app made to manage a [4L retrospective](http://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=Four_L%27s_Retrospective) session. I made this app in the first place to test the [Elm language](http://elm-lang.org/).

## Prerequisites
You need *Node v6.9+* and *npm v3+* to build and use this app. If you have `nvm` installed, simply use `nvm use` at the root of the project.

## Install
```
npm install && elm-package install
```

## Build
```
npm start
```
